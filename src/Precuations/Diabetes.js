      "Limit intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages high in added sugars. These can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels and contribute to insulin resistance.",
      "Include healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and fatty fish, in your diet. These fats can help improve insulin sensitivity and promote heart health.",
      "Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can affect blood sugar levels and contribute to fatigue and other symptoms.",
